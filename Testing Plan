Test subjects: 8 (x1 – x8)

Tests:
•	Solo – Playing on your own, no crowd feedback, only audio will be game audio

•	Friends (audio only) – Two players at a time playing tournament style rules, crowd audio feedback will be streamed to the players, the first game and the winners game will have the crowd being manipulated with x1–x2 and x1-x3(diagram below), the second game and the losers game will not be manipulated with x3-x4 and x2-x4.

•	Friends (audio and visual) – Two players at a time playing tournament style rules, crowd will be physically observing the players, giving audio and visual feedback instantly, the first game and the winners game will have the crowd being manipulated with x1–x2 and x1-x3(diagram below), the second game and the losers game will not be manipulated with x3-x4 and x2-x4. (x1-x4 are replaced with second group x5-x8)

•	Crowd (audio only) – similar again to friends, but the players may not know who all of the crowd is, in this test the players will not see the crowd, so there’s even more anonymity of the crowd, the game will be streamed to the crowd and the crowd audio will be streamed to the player (skype), **should the crowds be manipulated for the same players/games?**, same style tournament bracket for gameplay

•	Crowd (audio and visual) – same as last crowd, in this test the play-ers will see the crowd, so there’s less anonymity of the crowd to the players, adding the visual factor to the crowd, to see if the audi-ence being present during game play will cause the player to play/act differently, **should the crowds be manipulated for the same play-ers/games?**, same style tournament bracket for gameplay, different players again x5-x8


 
Diagram (visual in word, text in git):

X1 vs X2 – winner(X1) – winners game – X1 vs X3

X3 vs X4 – winner(X3) – losers game – X2 vs X4

With the friends and crowd being split into audio and visual I’m not 100% sure if the pre-recorded audio only is needed, could still be implemented if there is time

More games could also be added to the tournament if the game time seems too insignificant, there are still more game possibilities including rematches or best of 3 (also x1-x4 and x2-x3 never happens)




The game should be something quite casual but also competitive, so that the viewers in the audience can be kept interested also making sure that there is not a huge area for the player to improve their skills in the game too much, as this could somewhat falsify some of the data, but this isn’t too much of a priority.

A vs B

B vs C

•	Player assists
•	Player saves
•	Player shots
•	Bot score
•	Bot goals

Questions to ask players when testing has been completed

•	Is this the first time you’ve played this game?
•	

Questions:

How many games should players have to play? 1? 3? More?
How many test subjects should there be?
Should the player play with a Bot team mate?
How many Bots should be on the opposing team? (1-4 available)
What difficulty should the bots be?
If there are team bots are they the same difficulty as the opposing bots? 

Original Answers:

If there is only 1 game played per person, then there should probably be more test subjects
5-7 test subjects if there is only 1 game played
3-5 test subjects if there are 3/more games played
I think the teams should be even
2 players per team, player and bot vs 2 bots.
All bots on the second highest difficulty (find out what that is)
