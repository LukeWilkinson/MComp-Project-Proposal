Questions to ask players when testing has been completed

•	Is this the first time you’ve played this game?
•	

Questions:

How many games should players have to play? 1? 3? More?
How many test subjects should there be?
Should the player play with a Bot team mate?
How many Bots should be on the opposing team? (1-4 available)
What difficulty should the bots be?
If there are team bots are they the same difficulty as the opposing bots? 

Original Answers:

If there is only 1 game played per person, then there should probably be more test subjects
5-7 test subjects if there is only 1 game played
3-5 test subjects if there are 3/more games played
I think the teams should be even
2 players per team, player and bot vs 2 bots.
All bots on the second highest difficulty (find out what that is)
