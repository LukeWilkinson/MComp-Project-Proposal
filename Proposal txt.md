Crowd Influence in Video Games

Abstract

This project intends to explore and analyse the different effects and influences a crowd presents when video games are being played. With the many different forms of crowds in games there is a lot of room for exploration and investigation into this subject, it is rather uncommon these days for someone to have not been part of a video game crowd in some way, from playing games with friends and playing games online to watching lets plays, streamed games or e-sports. The intended result is to analyse and evaluate the effects that a crowd has on a person when playing a game, to see if the different types of crowds effect the way that a person performs when playing a game, exploring what could stimulate a player to perform in what manner depending on the type of crowd and the feedback given from the crowd.

Aims and Objectives

Aim:

To evaluate and analyse the performance and enjoyment of a player when playing video games in front of different crowds, to see if their gaming experience could be improved by the introduction or removal of a crowd. 

Objectives:

•	Investigate the different types of crowds that would be best to evaluate and test with players, exploring which scenario provides the most enjoyment to players, determining whether or not there is a fixed mechanic provided from the crowd that enhances the game play experience.

•	Examine games with virtual simulated crowds and the effect that they have on players.

•	Investigate and understand the different variables that crowds could add to the players game play experience.

•	Analyse the effects that a manipulated crowd and manipulated crowd audio could have on the player.

Background

Video games are game that are played electronically that provide a source of entertainment to the user, allowing them to simulate and relate to almost anything imaginable, whether it be something as simple as playing a game of football or something as complex as fighting giant monsters in space (Grodal et al, 2000). With the recent raising craze of lets plays, streamers and e-sports it is clear to see that entertainment can come from watching someone else play video games as well as playing them, “in fact, in a recent social study, casual players were found to prefer watching professional gamers rather than playing the game themselves” (Kayoute et al, 2012), this is no real surprise as this has also been the case for real sports for years, it would seem that most people would watch more European football games than they would play for themselves, the average attendance at English football stadiums in 2014/2015 was in the 10,000’s, some reaching as high as 75,000 as an average (Heimspiel Medien GmbH & Co. 2014).

In the past few decades it has become more and more common that a person would be brought up with or would own a video game console, one study found that “more than two-thirds of all children ages 2-18 live in a home with a video game system” (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2002). 

Methods

Project Management Methods

“Project management is the process of planning, organizing and managing tasks and resources to accomplish a defined objective” (Kumar, 2013), if a project is to succeed it must be properly planned and organized. There are a number of methods and tools that can be utilized to effectively reach the goals of the project, a number of them will be applied to ensure that this project is completed to the highest standard possible.

There are many different and effective project management tools and methods that would be suitable and effective to choose from in the production of this project, a Gantt chart would seem to be the most effective tool to produce for the purposes of this project, and it will be used to efficiently track the project, easily showing the progression as the project continues, displaying when different key points and milestones of the project have been completed, allowing the user to monitor the project ensuring that it is keeping to the project schedule. A task list will also be produced from the Gantt chart as it is a simplified adaptation of a Gantt chart which will simply keep all of the key information and milestones in a shortened list potentially integrated into a calendar as another useful tool to keep track of the milestones within the project life cycle. Brainstorming will be a small part of this project, but it will be an integral phase of the project, as it allows all potential ideas and information within the project to be plotted sorting the good from the bad and producing a list of all the best accumulated points which could be used within the project.

Research Methods

Words

Exhaustive research into the key fields of this project has and will be conducted during the life cycle of this project to ensure that the data collected is both relevant and interesting in the subject field. Research will be completed in social gaming/computing, 

Testing Methods? Software Analysis Methods?

Indications of milestones and time frames

A Gantt chart has been composed to enforce the structure of this project, ensuring that each task that needs to be completed for the project can and will be done with as much time and effort possible, ensuring that the project will be completed to the highest standard possible. The Gantt chart produced is an extremely useful tool for keeping track of the project and its estimated time frame, visualising when key parts of the project are completed, have to be completed and are estimated to be completed, allowing the user to easily see their progression through the project, letting them see if they are falling behind are if they are ahead of schedule at a glance. At the current stage of this project all of the planned start and finish points for each milestone have been plotted and work has started on a number of these elements, the Gantt chart will be updated during each week of the project to make sure the project stays within its current time frame.
 
Risk assessment

Risks assessments help protect projects from falling into disrepair, they make sure to take into account any and every predictable fault, failure, error and unhandled expectation that may occur during the projects life cycle. For the purposes of this project the risk assessment will look into: scheduling, hardware, software and test subjects/user testing. Each and every possible risk will be taken into consideration and plans will be made and put into place to ensure that these risks do not affect the project and to ensure that there is a viable back up plan if these risks do stop the progression of the project.

Project scheduling is vital in making sure that the project can be completed to a high standard in the time frame set by the project life cycle, if the project was to fall behind too drastically then it would have to be rushed or finalised at in an incomplete state, which would be unacceptable. The main protective measure which has been discussed above and put into place is a Gantt chart as it is a perfect tool for time keeping and scheduling, showing data in a format that gives the user all the information they need and is visually simple to read at a glance.

Both software and hardware can be factors that could stop the progress of a project drastically if they do not work correctly, because of the many different problems that could occur with these tools there will be various counter measures put into place to make sure the progress is not held up because of hardware/software troubles. Any work that can be saved will be kept backed up on multiple platforms (including cloud based platforms) regularly, this will mainly include the project documentation. Any testing scenarios that require users to test hardware or software will be thoroughly tested by the researcher before any outside users test to ensure that both the hardware and software run smoothly. If there is a problem with any specific computer/hardware that is being used for the purposes of this project there are many other computers at the researchers disposal ensuring that the project can definitely be completed in multiple locations on different machines, with back-ups saved in cloud storage the researcher will have access to recent versions of the documentation ensuring that progression into the project is possible.

Test subjects may be the most unpredictable risk within this project, the project requires test subjects to play or watch games at multiple stages, test subjects will be willing participants in this project and there may need to be a large number of test subject at different times during the project, organising a large crowd of people to meet at a single location at a specified time is not a straightforward task, there is no guarantee that all of the subjects will show up at the right place at the right time. Taking these factors into consideration there has been a large time frame allocated for testing purposes in case there are not enough subjects available to aid in the testing, there will also be a large number of people asked to participate in the test to ensure that if some test subjects do not show up during the tests then it will not have a dramatic impact on the project.

General Risk	Risk Description	Risk Likelihood	Risk Impact	Solution
				
Project falls behind schedule	The possibility that the project falls behind schedule due to any number of varying circumstances	Low	Medium	A Gantt chart and project plan has been produced for the project, ensuring that there is more than enough time to complete each task

Software/Hardware	Possible hardware or software failures that could delete work or stop the progress of work	Low	Low	Backups of the project will be made regularly on multiple platforms, and there are multiple university computers available to complete any task for this project

Test subject	Test subjects could possibly drop out or not participate in the testing phase of this project.	Medium	Medium	More subjects will be found within the scope of the project as there has been more than enough time allocated for testing

Notes

Test scenario:

User plays a game of Mario Kart/Rocket league 3 times, 1st time they play on their own (only other participants will be the other players), 2nd time they play with a small crowd (3-7 people) watching, 3rd time they play a game that is being streamed with a text chat on the same screen as the game play (crowd number could variate)

The results of each scenario will be recorded and displayed against each other to see if the varying factors of the different crowds have any effect on the player’s performance during game play

The results may look for things such as: did the player do better because the crowd provided some key information to the player, did they do worse because the crowd provided false information, did they do better because of positive encouragement from the crowd, did they do worse because of negative encouragement, did they try harder to win when there was a crowd, were they happier/sadder when the won/lost a game when the crowd was/wasn’t there, did the crowd’s reaction make them want to play the game more? (To get better to keep them encouraging them or to prove to them that they can do better), did the people in the crowd effect the way they played? (If its people they knew vs people they didn’t know would they play differently or would that effect their game play in any way? Does the age or sex of the crowd also become a factor, if the crowd is a similar age to the player would that affect them in any way, if the crowd had never seen or played the game could that also effect the player because of the crowds reactions not being that of a typical crowd member where they would most likely fully understand the rules and what is going on in the game), did the type of crowd effect the player (real people in the room with them vs a crowd of real people that can only communicate with them online through text chat), 

Tests: solo game, solo & physical observers (friends), solo & twitch (online) observers (possibly friends too), lecture hall 
sized crowd
What should the end goal be?
A game designed where crowd participation is a key element? 
Game designed could be a party game style of game (jackbox, Mario kart, smash)

(Note – possibly investigate the impact that lets plays and streams have on the game industry market, are people more or less likely to purchase a game because they have already seen someone else play it)
Factors in different games that can affect the game differently: music in horror games, trivia games have different sounds that play after a player does good or bad indicating that they have done so, some games give players doing better or worse better items, equipment or boosts depending on how well they’re doing (winning and losing streak in gta 5, shitty items for 1st place and good items for people in last in Mario kart etc…),
