Crowd Influence in Video Games

Abstract

This project intends to explore and analyse the different effects and influences a crowd presents when video games are being played. With the many different forms of crowds in games there is a lot of room for exploration and investigation into this subject, it is rather uncommon these days for someone to have not been part of a video game crowd in some way, from playing games with friends and playing games online to watching lets plays, streamed games or e-sports. The intended result is to analyse and evaluate the effects that a crowd has on a person when playing a game, to see if the different types of crowds effect the way that a person performs when playing a game, exploring what could stimulate a player to perform in what manner depending on the type of crowd and the feedback given from the crowd.

Aims and Objectives

Aim:

To evaluate and analyse the performance and enjoyment of a player when playing video games in front of different crowds, to see if their gaming experience could be improved by the introduction or removal of a crowd. 

Objectives:

•	Investigate the different types of crowds that would be best to evaluate and test with players, exploring which scenario provides the most enjoyment to players, determining whether or not there is a fixed mechanic provided from the crowd that enhances the game play experience.
•	Examine games with virtual simulated crowds and the effect that they have on players.
•	Investigate and understand the different variables that crowds could add to the players game play experience.
•

Methods

Project Management Methods

There are many different and effective project management tools and methods that would be suitable and effective to use within this project, a Gantt chart would seem to be the most effective tool to produce for the purposes of this project, and it will be used to efficiently track the project, easily showing the progression as the project continues, displaying when different key points and milestones of the project have been completed, allowing the user to monitor the project ensuring that it is keeping to the project schedule. A task list will also be produced from the Gantt chart as it is a simplified adaptation of a Gantt chart which will simply keep all of the key information and milestones in a shortened list potentially integrated into a calendar as another useful tool to keep track of the milestones within the project life cycle. Brainstorming will be a small part of this project, but it will be an integral phase of the project, as it allows all potential ideas and information within the project to be plotted sorting the good from the bad and producing a list of all the best accumulated points which could be used within the project.

Indications of milestones and time frames

A Gantt chart has been composed to enforce the structure of this project, ensuring that each task that needs to be completed for the project can and will be done with as much time and effort possible, ensuring that the project will be completed to the highest standard possible. The Gantt chart produced is an extremely useful tool for keeping track of the project and its estimated time frame, visualising when key parts of the project are completed, have to be completed and are estimated to be completed, allowing the user to easily see their progression through the project, letting them see if they are falling behind are if they are ahead of schedule at a glance. At the current stage of this project all of the planned start and finish points for each milestone have been plotted and work has started on a number of these elements, the Gantt chart will be updated during each week of the project to make sure the project stays within its current time frame.
 
Risk assessment

Words, words, words.

General Risk	Risk Description	Risk Likelihood	Risk Impact	Solution
				
Project falls behind schedule	The possibility that the project falls behind schedule due to any number of varying circumstances	Low	Medium	A Gantt chart and project plan has been produced for the project, ensuring that there is more than enough time to complete each task

Software/Hardware	Possible hardware or software failures that could delete work or stop the progress of work	Low	Low	Backups of the project will be made regularly on multiple platforms, and there are multiple university computers available to complete any task for this project

Test subject	Test subjects could possibly drop out or not participate in the testing phase of this project.	Medium	Medium	More subjects will be found within the scope of the project as there has been more than enough time allocated for testing

Notes

Test scenario:

User plays a game of Mario Kart/Rocket league 3 times, 1st time they play on their own (only other participants will be the other players), 2nd time they play with a small crowd (3-7 people) watching, 3rd time they play a game that is being streamed with a text chat on the same screen as the game play (crowd number could variate)

The results of each scenario will be recorded and displayed against each other to see if the varying factors of the different crowds have any effect on the player’s performance during game play

The results may look for things such as: did the player do better because the crowd provided some key information to the player, did they do worse because the crowd provided false information, did they do better because of positive encouragement from the crowd, did they do worse because of negative encouragement, did they try harder to win when there was a crowd, were they happier/sadder when the won/lost a game when the crowd was/wasn’t there, did the crowd’s reaction make them want to play the game more? (To get better to keep them encouraging them or to prove to them that they can do better), did the people in the crowd effect the way they played? (If its people they knew vs people they didn’t know would they play differently or would that effect their game play in any way? Does the age or sex of the crowd also become a factor, if the crowd is a similar age to the player would that affect them in any way, if the crowd had never seen or played the game could that also effect the player because of the crowds reactions not being that of a typical crowd member where they would most likely fully understand the rules and what is going on in the game), did the type of crowd effect the player (real people in the room with them vs a crowd of real people that can only communicate with them online through text chat), 

What should the end goal be?

A game designed where crowd participation is a key element? 
Game designed could be a party game style of game (jackbox, Mario kart, smash)

(Note – possibly investigate the impact that lets plays and streams have on the game industry market, are people more or less likely to purchase a game because they have already seen someone else play it)
Factors in different games that can affect the game differently: music in horror games, trivia games have different sounds that play after a player does good or bad indicating that they have done so, some games give players doing better or worse better items, equipment or boosts depending on how well they’re doing (winning and losing streak in gta 5, shitty items for 1st place and good items for people in last in Mario kart etc…),
