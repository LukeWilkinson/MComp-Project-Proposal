Crowd Influence in Video Games

Abstract

This project intends to explore and analyse the different effects and influences a crowd presents when video games are being played. With the many different forms of crowds in games there is a lot of room for exploration and investigation into this subject. It is rather uncommon these days for someone to have not been part of a video game crowd in some way, from playing games with friends or family and playing games online to watching lets plays, streamed games or e-sports. The intended result of this project is to analyse and evaluate the effects that a crowd has on a person when playing a game, to see if the different types of crowds effect the way that a person performs when playing a game, exploring what could stimulate a player to perform in what manner depending on the type of crowd and the feedback given from the crowd.

Aims and Objectives

Aim:

To evaluate and analyse the performance and enjoyment of a player when playing video games in front of different crowds, to see if their gaming experience or performance could be influenced by the reactions of the crowd.

Objectives:

•	Explore and analyse different forms of crowds that would be best to use and evaluate with players in test scenarios 
composed within a literature review.

•	Investigate and understand the different variables crowds could introduce to the players gaming experience, determining whether or not there is a fixed mechanic the crowd provides to enhance the players gaming experience

•	Analyse the effects that a manipulated crowd and manipulated crowd audio could have on the player.

•	Produce a report composed of all the research and findings made as a result of the completed project.

Background

Video games are game that are played electronically that provide a source of entertainment to the user, allowing them to simulate and relate to almost anything imaginable. Whether it be something as simple as playing a game of football or something as complex as fighting giant monsters in space (Grodal et al, 2000). With the recent raising craze of lets plays, streamers and e-sports it is clear to see that entertainment can come from watching someone else play video games as well as playing them, “in fact, in a recent social study, casual players were found to prefer watching professional gamers rather than playing the game themselves” (Kayoute et al, 2012). This is no real surprise as this has also been the case for real sports for years, it would seem that most people would watch more European football games than they would play for themselves, the average attendance at English football stadiums in 2014/2015 was in the 10,000’s, some reaching as high as 75,000 as an average (Heimspiel Medien GmbH & Co. 2014).

Crowds can definitely vary in many different ways, one clear variation in a crowd is what side that it is routing for, is the side cheerig for you, or against you? Whether you’re playing against an opponent or not this could occur. This is clear to see in some formats, for instance, sports games will have two main types of attendees, home team supporters and away team supporters. It would not be unreasonable to assume that there would be more home team supporters as the game would be more accessible to those from the home town. A study into crowd effect on sport in performance found that the bigger the home crowds were would generally lead to a higher percentage of home team wins (Agnew and Carron, 1994). This can however work both ways, as the home team would presumably have more supporters spectating, this would also mean that there would be more pressure put to them to perform, giving the away team an advantage as there would be less disappointed physical spectators if they lost, and the satisfaction of home team discouragement (Hallam, 2014).

In the past few decades it has become more and more common that a person would be brought up with or would own a video game console, one study found that “more than two-thirds of all children ages 2-18 live in a home with a video game system” (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2002). With growing up with video games being the norm now, it is understandable that most people are playing these games with friends, family or others online. Either taking turns, playing with or against or simply watching others play video games includes some kind of crowd, even if it is just with a small group of friends or family, and this social even is clearly a preferred form of entertainment in most households, shown by a study completed in 2013. The study found that 62% of the gamers played with others, either online on in person. 77% of which played with others at least an hour a week, mainly played with friends or family members (Entertainment Software Association, 2013).

Social facilitation is an interesting topic within this project, social facilitation is the theory that people excel in performance when in the presence of others (Strauss, 2002). This project intends to explore deeper into this theory, analysing the different effects that different sizes of crowds and different reactions of crowds express can have on the person performing the task. There are obviously many different factors and variables that can determine the outcome of a game or performance, in 1982 a test was carried out on people playing pool with spectators watching to determine players level of skill, they found that skilled players successfully made two thirds of all of their shots taken, but non-skilled players missed two thirds of their shots. The test was replicated this time with the spectators moved closer to the game, skilled players performance improved by 14% while non-skilled players performance decreased by over 30% (Michaels et al, 1982).

For this project there will a number of different types of audiences, self as audience (self-deliberation), small group of friends, audience on the web and a large audience. Each of these audiences could alter the performance of the player in a number of varying ways, each pose different factors that can put different amounts of pressure on the player to perform. For example, cheering and booing and other forms of encouragement or discouragement could make the player put different amounts of effort in to the game they are playing. If a player is being cheered on it is likely that they will try harder to keep up the crowd’s reaction, if the player is being booed then the opposite could happen and they may put less effort in to winning because they may not even get any appreciation or recognition from the audience if they win. Opposed to this if the player is being booed then they may put even more effort in to prove the crowd wrong and have the satisfaction of showing others that they are capable of completing a task even when everyone else is against them. If the player is on their own as a self-audience then the only people they are performing for is themselves so the only encouragement or discouragement they will receive will be from themselves. This project intends to determine which these theories of the outcomes of the different crowd participation scenarios are true and if there is a preferred audience that made the players excel in their performance, or if there was an audience that game them the most enjoyment from the game.

The concept of non-players is interesting within this project, because there will be a crowd of people watching each game that not be playing the game, but could possibly influence the game in a number of ways. A non-player is someone who is present during a game that can have a varying amount of influence on the game in play, for example, a referee in a sports game has a lot of influence within the game even though they are not playing the game, they ensure that the game in play follows all the rules of the game. Another example would be the spectator, they can offer differing amounts of influence in a game, offering encouragement or discouragement to the players by cheering or booing, and they can also provide them with tactical information about the game through verbal and visual communication with the players (Montola et al, 2006). 

Crowds are present in a number of forms and so are performers, the relationship between the two can vary depending on the situation and format in which the performance is presented to the audience in. The ‘humanaquarium’ project looked into a different way to present a performance to the audience with different ways for audience to interact and participate. This project involved a movable performance space with two musicians performing inside the space which had a touch sensitive interface which allowed audience members to enter the performance frame and take an active role in the co-creation of a live audio-visual performance (Taylor et al. 2011). This project intended to allow the audience to interact with the performance in a new way, allowing the audience to directly participate with or alter the performance in a unique way that most individuals may not have seen before, allowing non-players roles to be changed in quite a drastic way considering the direct influence they could have on the performance.

Methods

Project Management Methods

“Project management is the process of planning, organizing and managing tasks and resources to accomplish a defined objective” (Kumar, 2013), if a project is to succeed it must be properly planned and organized. There are a number of methods and tools that can be utilized to effectively reach the goals of the project, a number of them will be applied to ensure that this project is completed to the highest standard possible.

There are many different and effective project management tools and methods that would be suitable and effective to choose from in the production of this project, a Gantt chart would seem to be the most effective tool to produce for the purposes of this project, and it will be used to efficiently track the project, easily showing the progression as the project continues, displaying when different key points and milestones of the project have been completed, allowing the user to monitor the project ensuring that it is keeping to the project schedule. A task list will also be produced from the Gantt chart as it is a simplified adaptation of a Gantt chart which will simply keep all of the key information and milestones in a shortened list potentially integrated into a calendar as another useful tool to keep track of the milestones within the project life cycle. Brainstorming will be a small part of this project, but it will be an integral phase of the project, as it allows all potential ideas and information within the project to be plotted sorting the good from the bad and producing a list of all the best accumulated points which could be used within the project.

Research Methods

Extensive research will continue until the final completion of this project, there will be thorough research in to all of the key topics and areas of interest, mainly consisting of research into crowds and audiences, video games, social facilitation and player enjoyment and performance with the crowd influence. A great deal of effort will go into investigating these key fields to ensure that the findings of this project are accurate and relevant, looking into great detail on how the crowd/audience can affect the player’s performance, enjoyment and experience whilst playing the game.

Development Methodology

The final artefact for this project as stated by the aims and objectives is a report, to ensure that this report is produced to the highest standards capable there are a number of steps which need to be taken, these can be laid out using a methodology plan. Even though this project involves no software development, many software development methodologies still fit this project perfectly. There are many different methodologies that could potentially be used within this project, a number of them will be analysed below to determine which would be the best fit for this project.

Waterfall Method

The waterfall model follows a plan-driven process architecture where all the steps of the project are planned in stages before they can be started, this model is designed is an way that’s ordered so that only one step of the project can be worked on at a time, allowing the project to be divided into smaller chunks, making the work more manageable and easier to plan within the time span of the project life-cycle. The waterfall method could be utilized in this project as its structure is useful for time management and planning, the Gantt chart produced for this project shows some implication of the waterfall method, with some sections overlapping. This method is present in the projects current state, as the testing cannot be completed without thorough research being completed to ensure that all the necessary and relevant data can and will be collected for the project to be successful.

Quantitative Research

Quantitative research is research involved with data that can be collected in a measurable quantity, looking into statistical, mathematical and or computational techniques of analysing and processing the data that has been collected. Within this project quantitative research could be useful for collecting game data when the player is playing with different crowds, such as: game’s won/lost, game duration and crowd size. More game data could be collected and quantitative data could also be collected from a questionnaire that could be completed by the player/audience members after the testing.

Qualitative Research

Qualitative research investigates all the how’s and why’s of decision making, this method can get more detailed answers from questions other than mathematical or statistical data, looking for more than the what, when, where and who. Qualitative research is most commonly collected in the form of an interview, this will be useful for the purposes of this project because there is more than just game data that can be useful to collect in this project, data such as the amount of enjoyment/pressure etc. that the player got from each different game with each different crowd, it would be useful to collect a descriptive response for these questions as there may be more data collected from the players perspective, rather than just a numerical value assigned to the levels of enjoyment/pressure etc.
Indications of milestones and time frames

A Gantt chart has been composed to enforce the structure of this project, ensuring that each task that needs to be completed for the project can and will be done with as much time and effort possible, ensuring that the project will be completed to the highest standard possible. The Gantt chart produced is an extremely useful tool for keeping track of the project and its estimated time frame, visualising when key parts of the project are completed, have to be completed and are estimated to be completed, allowing the user to easily see their progression through the project, letting them see if they are falling behind are if they are ahead of schedule at a glance. At the current stage of this project all of the planned start and finish points for each milestone have been plotted and work has started on a number of these elements, the Gantt chart will be updated during each week of the project to make sure the project stays within its current time frame.
 
Risk assessment

Risks assessments help protect projects from falling into disrepair, they make sure to take into account any and every predictable fault, failure, error and unhandled expectation that may occur during the projects life cycle. For the purposes of this project the risk assessment will look into: scheduling, hardware, software and test subjects/user testing. Each and every possible risk will be taken into consideration and plans will be made and put into place to ensure that these risks do not affect the project and to ensure that there is a viable back up plan if these risks do stop the progression of the project.

Project scheduling is vital in making sure that the project can be completed to a high standard in the time frame set by the project life cycle, if the project was to fall behind too drastically then it would have to be rushed or finalised at in an incomplete state, which would be unacceptable. The main protective measure which has been discussed above and put into place is a Gantt chart as it is a perfect tool for time keeping and scheduling, showing data in a format that gives the user all the information they need and is visually simple to read at a glance.

Both software and hardware can be factors that could stop the progress of a project drastically if they do not work correctly, because of the many different problems that could occur with these tools there will be various counter measures put into place to make sure the progress is not held up because of hardware/software troubles. Any work that can be saved will be kept backed up on multiple platforms (including cloud based platforms) regularly, this will mainly include the project documentation. Any testing scenarios that require users to test hardware or software will be thoroughly tested by the researcher before any outside users test to ensure that both the hardware and software run smoothly. If there is a problem with any specific computer/hardware that is being used for the purposes of this project there are many other computers at the researchers disposal ensuring that the project can definitely be completed in multiple locations on different machines, with back-ups saved in cloud storage the researcher will have access to recent versions of the documentation ensuring that progression into the project is possible.

Test subjects may be the most unpredictable risk within this project, the project requires test subjects to play or watch games at multiple stages, test subjects will be willing participants in this project and there may need to be a large number of test subject at different times during the project, organising a large crowd of people to meet at a single location at a specified time is not a straightforward task, there is no guarantee that all of the subjects will show up at the right place at the right time. Taking these factors into consideration there has been a large time frame allocated for testing purposes in case there are not enough subjects available to aid in the testing, there will also be a large number of people asked to participate in the test to ensure that if some test subjects do not show up during the tests then it will not have a dramatic impact on the project.

General Risk	Risk Description	Risk Likelihood	Risk Impact	Solution
				
Project falls behind schedule	The possibility that the project falls behind schedule due to any number of varying circumstances	Low	Medium	A Gantt chart and project plan has been produced for the project, ensuring that there is more than enough time to complete each task

Software/Hardware	Possible hardware or software failures that could delete work or stop the progress of work	Low	Low	Backups of the project will be made regularly on multiple platforms, and there are multiple university computers available to complete any task for this project

Test subject	Test subjects could possibly drop out or not participate in the testing phase of this project.	Medium	Medium	More subjects will be found within the scope of the project as there has been more than enough time allocated for testing
