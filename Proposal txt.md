Crowd Influence in Video Games

Abstract

This project intends to explore and analyse the different effects and influences a crowd presents when video games are being played. With the many different forms of crowds in games there is a lot of room for exploration and investigation into this subject. It is rather uncommon these days for someone to have not been part of a video game crowd in some way, from playing games with friends or family and playing games online to watching lets plays, streamed games or e-sports. The intended result of this project is to analyse and evaluate the effects that a crowd has on a person when playing a game, to see if the different types of crowds effect the way that a person performs when playing a game, exploring what could stimulate a player to perform in what manner depending on the type of crowd and the feedback given from the crowd.

Background

??? headings to break up.

Video games are game that are played electronically that provide a source of entertainment to the user, allowing them to simulate and relate to almost anything imaginable. Whether it be something as simple as playing a game of football or something as complex as fighting giant monsters in space (Grodal et al, 2000). With the recent raising craze of lets plays, streamers and e-sports it is clear to see that entertainment can come from watching someone else play video games as well as playing them, “in fact, in a recent social study, casual players were found to prefer watching professional gamers rather than playing the game themselves” (Kayoute et al, 2012). This is no real surprise as this has also been the case for real sports for years, it would seem that most people would watch more European football games than they would play for themselves, the average attendance at English football stadiums in 2014/2015 was in the 10,000’s, some reaching as high as 75,000 as an average (Heimspiel Medien GmbH & Co. 2014).Indications of milestones and time frames

A Gantt chart has been composed to enforce the structure of this project, ensuring that each task that needs to be completed for the project can and will be done with as much time and effort possible, ensuring that the project will be completed to the highest standard possible. The Gantt chart produced is an extremely useful tool for keeping track of the project and its estimated time frame, visualising when key parts of the project are completed, have to be completed and are estimated to be completed, allowing the user to easily see their progression through the project, letting them see if they are falling behind are if they are ahead of schedule at a glance. At the current stage of this project all of the planned start and finish points for each milestone have been plotted and work has started on a number of these elements, the Gantt chart will be updated during each week of the project to make sure the project stays within its current time frame.
rters. It would not be unreasonable to assume that there would be more home team supporters as the game would be more accessible to those from the home town. A study into crowd effect on sport in performance found that the bigger the home crowds were would generally lead to a higher percentage of home team wins (Agnew and Carron, 1994). This can however work both ways, as the home team would presumably have more supporters spectating, this would also mean that there would be more pressure put to them to perform, giving the away team an advantage as there would be less disappointed physical spectators if they lost, and the satisfaction of home team discouragement (Hallam, 2014).

In the past few decades it has become more and more common that a person would be brought up with or would own a video game console, one study found that “more than two-thirds of all children ages 2-18 live in a home with a video game system” (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2002). With growing up with video games being the norm now, it is understandable that most people are playing these games with friends, family or others online. Either taking turns, playing with or against or simply watching others play video games includes some kind of crowd, even if it is just with a small group of friends or family, and this social even is clearly a preferred form of entertainment in most households, shown by a study completed in 2013. The study found that 62% of the gamers played with others, either online on in person. 77% of which played with others at least an hour a week, mainly played with friends or family members (Entertainment Software Association, 2013).

Social facilitation is an interesting topic within this project, social facilitation is the theory that people excel in performance when in the presence of others (Strauss, 2002). This project intends to explore deeper into this theory, analysing the different effects that different sizes of crowds and different reactions of crowds express can have on the person performing the task. There are obviously many different factors and variables that can determine the outcome of a game or performance, in 1982 a test was carried out on people playing pool with spectators watching to determine players level of skill, they found that skilled players successfully made two thirds of all of their shots taken, but non-skilled players missed two thirds of their shots. The test was replicated this time with the spectators moved closer to the game, skilled players performance improved by 14% while non-skilled players performance decreased by over 30% (Michaels et al, 1982).

For this project there will a number of different types of audiences, self as audience (self-deliberation), small group of friends, audience on the web and a large audience. Each of these audiences could alter the performance of the player in a number of varying ways, each pose different factors that can put different amounts of pressure on the player to perform. For example, cheering and booing and other forms of encouragement or discouragement could make the player put different amounts of effort in to the game they are playing. If a player is being cheered on it is likely that they will try harder to keep up the crowd’s reaction, if the player is being booed then the opposite could happen and they may put less effort in to winning because they may not even get any appreciation or recognition from the audience if they win. Opposed to this if the player is being booed then they may put even more effort in to prove the crowd wrong and have the satisfaction of showing others that they are capable of completing a task even when everyone else is against them. If the player is on their own as a self-audience then the only people they are performing for is themselves so the only encouragement or discouragement they will receive will be from themselves. This project intends to determine which these theories of the outcomes of the different crowd participation scenarios are true and if there is a preferred audience that made the players excel in their performance, or if there was an audience that game them the most enjoyment from the game.

The concept of non-players is interesting within this project, because there will be a crowd of people watching each game that not be playing the game, but could possibly influence the game in a number of ways. A non-player is someone who is present during a game that can have a varying amount of influence on the game in play, for example, a referee in a sports game has a lot of influence within the game even though they are not playing the game, they ensure that the game in play follows all the rules of the game. Another example would be the spectator, they can offer differing amounts of influence in a game, offering encouragement or discouragement to the players by cheering or booing, and they can also provide them with tactical information about the game through verbal and visual communication with the players (Montola et al, 2006).

Crowds are present in a number of forms and so are performers, the relationship between the two can vary depending on the situation and format in which the performance is presented to the audience in. The ‘humanaquarium’ project looked into a different way to present a performance to the audience with different ways for audience to interact and participate. This project involved a movable performance space with two musicians performing inside the space which had a touch sensitive interface which allowed audience members to enter the performance frame and take an active role in the co-creation of a live audio-visual performance (Taylor et al. 2011). This project intended to allow the audience to interact with the performance in a new way, allowing the audience to directly participate with or alter the performance in a unique way that most individuals may not have seen before, allowing non-players roles to be changed in quite a drastic way considering the direct influence they could have on the performance.


Methods

Project Management Methods

“Project management is the process of planning, organizing and managing tasks and resources to accomplish a defined objective” (Kumar, 2013), if a project is to succeed it must be properly planned and organized. There are a number of methods and tools that can be utilized to effectively reach the goals of the project, a number of them will be applied to ensure that this project is completed to the highest standard possible.

There are many different and effective project management tools and methods that would be suitable and effective to choose from in the production of this project, a Gantt chart would seem to be the most effective tool to produce for the purposes of this project, and it will be used to efficiently track the project, easily showing the progression as the project continues, displaying when different key points and milestones of the project have been completed, allowing the user to monitor the project ensuring that it is keeping to the project schedule. A task list will also be produced from the Gantt chart as it is a simplified adaptation of a Gantt chart which will simply keep all of the key information and milestones in a shortened list potentially integrated into a calendar as another useful tool to keep track of the milestones within the project life cycle. Brainstorming will be a small part of this project, but it will be an integral phase of the project, as it allows all potential ideas and information within the project to be plotted sorting the good from the bad and producing a list of all the best accumulated points which could be used within the project.

With the project management tools that have or will be put in place for this project it is easier to split the project into different stages and sections so that progress can be made on different sections at a time. This allows each section to be timed and planned around the time scale of the project, ensuring that the project will be completed within the project life-cycle and adequate time can be allocated to each section, to make sure that each section is completed to the highest standard possible. With help from the Gantt chart it would seem that this project could be split into four major sections, consisting of: research, testing, evaluation and documentation. Each section has been allocated a specific amount of time that should be adequate considering the magnitude of each task, with these sections being split into separate parts again within the sections in the Gantt chart to allow the researcher to visually see the progress within each section, allowing time to be reallocated if the project seems to be falling behind schedule.

Research Methods

Extensive research will continue until the final completion of this project, there will be thorough research in to all of the key topics and areas of interest, mainly consisting of research into crowds and audiences, video games, social facilitation and player enjoyment and performance with the crowd influence. A great deal of effort will go into investigating these key fields to ensure that the findings of this project are accurate and relevant, looking into great detail on how the crowd/audience can affect the player’s performance, enjoyment and experience whilst playing the game.

The research section has been split into four different sections to allow time to be allocated efficiently within the project, these sections are: crowd research, game research, testing/software research and design research.

??? sub-headings

Crowd research will involve looking into different forms of crowds that can be present within different forms of media events, and the amount of influence that crowds can have or are given. For example crowds at a traditional English pantomime will have more influence with the performance over crowds observing a game of golf, this is because pantomime crowds are expected to feel like they are part of the performance, interacting directly with the talent on stage. Whereas crowds at a golf game are expected to be quite for a lot of the game to allow the players to concentrate when they are taking a shot, only providing encouragement once the shot has been taken.

The game research section will consist of finding a game that will be suitable for the testing process of this project. A game will need to be selected depending on a number of factors, ensuring that the data collected from the tests are relevant, plentiful and adequate for the purposes of this project. The game will need to be engaging enough to keep the fascination of the spectators and players for the duration of the tests, while having some data that can be collected quantitatively such as wins/losses, game duration, lives lost etc. The game will also need to have attributes to ensure that there is not too much of a learning curve, it is imperative for the project that each game/round be unique to ensure that the player does not have a noticeable increase or decrease in skill level. In most games it is common that players would keep improving their skills in the game, starting out with little to no skill, progressing through getting better with each game. If the players are getting visibly better with each game in these tests then the data collected may not be completely accurate, it may not be the variables introduced into the game via this project that could factor their gameplay.

Testing/software research would most likely be completed after the game and crowd research had been completed because it will take into account quite a few factors from both of them. Once the crowd research has been completed it will be clear to see what the project should look for when testing, looking into which factors the crowd can add to the influence in game play. Once the game research has been completed the software can be acquired and set up for the testing, including the game that will be played throughout the tests.

Design research will look into designing a number of different tools throughout the initial testing, including such things as, questionnaires, interviews, possible programs that could be developed for the purposes of this project, possible game design documents that could be produced as a result of this project and of course the report that will be completed at the end of this project.

Development Methodology

The final artefact for this project as stated by the aims and objectives is a report, to ensure that this report is produced to the highest standards capable there are a number of steps which need to be taken, these can be laid out using a methodology plan. Even though this project involves no software development, many software development methodologies still fit this project perfectly. There are many different methodologies that could potentially be used within this project, a number of them will be analysed below to determine which would be the best fit for this project.

Waterfall Method

The waterfall model follows a plan-driven process architecture where all the steps of the project are planned in stages before they can be started, this model is designed is an way that’s ordered so that only one step of the project can be worked on at a time, allowing the project to be divided into smaller chunks, making the work more manageable and easier to plan within the time span of the project life-cycle. The waterfall method could be utilized in this project as its structure is useful for time management and planning, the Gantt chart produced for this project shows some implication of the waterfall method, with some sections overlapping. This method is present in the projects current state, as the testing cannot be completed without thorough research being completed to ensure that all the necessary and relevant data can and will be collected for the project to be successful.

Quantitative Research

Quantitative research is research involved with data that can be collected in a measurable quantity, looking into statistical, mathematical and or computational techniques of analysing and processing the data that has been collected. Within this project quantitative research could be useful for collecting game data when the player is playing with different crowds, such as: game’s won/lost, game duration and crowd size. More game data could be collected and quantitative data could also be collected from a questionnaire that could be completed by the player/audience members after the testing.

Qualitative Research

Qualitative research investigates all the how’s and why’s of decision making, this method can get more detailed answers from questions other than mathematical or statistical data, looking for more than the what, when, where and who. Qualitative research is most commonly collected in the form of an interview, this will be useful for the purposes of this project because there is more than just game data that can be useful to collect in this project, data such as the amount of enjoyment/pressure etc. that the player got from each different game with each different crowd, it would be useful to collect a descriptive response for these questions as there may be more data collected from the players perspective, rather than just a numerical value assigned to the levels of enjoyment/pressure etc.

Indications of milestones and time frames

A Gantt chart has been composed to enforce the structure of this project, ensuring that each task that needs to be completed for the project can and will be done with as much time and effort possible, ensuring that the project will be completed to the highest standard possible. The Gantt chart produced is an extremely useful tool for keeping track of the project and its estimated time frame, visualising when key parts of the project are completed, have to be completed and are estimated to be completed, allowing the user to easily see their progression through the project, letting them see if they are falling behind are if they are ahead of schedule at a glance. At the current stage of this project all of the planned start and finish points for each milestone have been plotted and work has started on a number of these elements, the Gantt chart will be updated during each week of the project to make sure the project stays within its current time frame.

Risk assessment

Risks assessments help protect projects from falling into disrepair, they make sure to take into account any and every predictable fault, failure, error and unhandled expectation that may occur during the projects life cycle. For the purposes of this project the risk assessment will look into: scheduling, hardware, software and test subjects/user testing. Each and every possible risk will be taken into consideration and plans will be made and put into place to ensure that these risks do not affect the project and to ensure that there is a viable back up plan if these risks do stop the progression of the project.

Project scheduling is vital in making sure that the project can be completed to a high standard in the time frame set by the project life cycle, if the project was to fall behind too drastically then it would have to be rushed or finalised at in an incomplete state, which would be unacceptable. The main protective measure which has been discussed above and put into place is a Gantt chart as it is a perfect tool for time keeping and scheduling, showing data in a format that gives the user all the information they need and is visually simple to read at a glance.

Both software and hardware can be factors that could stop the progress of a project drastically if they do not work correctly, because of the many different problems that could occur with these tools there will be various counter measures put into place to make sure the progress is not held up because of hardware/software troubles. Any work that can be saved will be kept backed up on multiple platforms (including cloud based platforms) regularly, this will mainly include the project documentation. Any testing scenarios that require users to test hardware or software will be thoroughly tested by the researcher before any outside users test to ensure that both the hardware and software run smoothly. If there is a problem with any specific computer/hardware that is being used for the purposes of this project there are many other computers at the researchers disposal ensuring that the project can definitely be completed in multiple locations on different machines, with back-ups saved in cloud storage the researcher will have access to recent versions of the documentation ensuring that progression into the project is possible.

Test subjects may be the most unpredictable risk within this project, the project requires test subjects to play or watch games at multiple stages, test subjects will be willing participants in this project and there may need to be a large number of test subject at different times during the project, organising a large crowd of people to meet at a single location at a specified time is not a straightforward task, there is no guarantee that all of the subjects will show up at the right place at the right time. Taking these factors into consideration there has been a large time frame allocated for testing purposes in case there are not enough subjects available to aid in the testing, there will also be a large number of people asked to participate in the test to ensure that if some test subjects do not show up during the tests then it will not have a dramatic impact on the project.

Notes
Test scenario:
User plays a game of Mario Kart/Rocket league 3 times, 1st time they play on their own (only other participants will be the other players), 2nd time they play with a small crowd (3-7 people) watching, 3rd time they play a game that is being streamed with a text chat on the same screen as the game play (crowd number could variate)
The results of each scenario will be recorded and displayed against each other to see if the varying factors of the different crowds have any effect on the player’s performance during game play
The results may look for things such as: did the player do better because the crowd provided some key information to the player, did they do worse because the crowd provided false information, did they do better because of positive encouragement from the crowd, did they do worse because of negative encouragement, did they try harder to win when there was a crowd, were they happier/sadder when the won/lost a game when the crowd was/wasn’t there, did the crowd’s reaction make them want to play the game more? (To get better to keep them encouraging them or to prove to them that they can do better), did the people in the crowd effect the way they played? (If its people they knew vs people they didn’t know would they play differently or would that effect their game play in any way? Does the age or sex of the crowd also become a factor, if the crowd is a similar age to the player would that affect them in any way, if the crowd had never seen or played the game could that also effect the player because of the crowds reactions not being that of a typical crowd member where they would most likely fully understand the rules and what is going on in the game), did the type of crowd effect the player (real people in the room with them vs a crowd of real people that can only communicate with them online through text chat),
Tests: solo game, solo & physical observers (friends), solo & twitch (online) observers (possibly friends too), lecture hall sized crowd

What should the end goal be?
A game designed where crowd participation is a key element?
Game designed could be a party game style of game (jackbox, Mario kart, smash)

(Note – possibly investigate the impact that lets plays and streams have on the game industry market, are people more or less likely to purchase a game because they have already seen someone else play it)
Factors in different games that can affect the game differently: music in horror games, trivia games have different sounds that play after a player does good or bad indicating that they have done so, some games give players doing better or worse better items, equipment or boosts depending on how well they’re doing (winning and losing streak in gta 5, shitty items for 1st place and good items for people in last in Mario kart etc…),

A study into LAN gaming found that many gamers that attended a LAN event would play video games daily for around 2.6 hours, these gamers stated that they were motivated by social contact and a need to know more about the games as well as a competitive motive. This shows that there are a number of reasons that people would want to meet in large groups to watch and or play video games as a community
